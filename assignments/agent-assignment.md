# Agent Assignment
## Steps
- Star our [Awesome Saas repo](https://github.com/alchemyst-ai/awesome-saas)
- Sign up on our [Alchemyst Platform](https://platform.getalchemystai.com)
- Get an API Key
- Use our [**LLM proxy**](https://getalchemystai.com/#get-started)
- Create 3 agents, upload them on Github. Use these topics for your Github repo: `alchemyst-awesome-saas`, `alchemyst-awesome-saas-<TOPIC_NAME>`, where TOPIC_NAME is a keyword. For example, you would have something like `alchemyst-awesome-saas` and `alchemyst-awesome-saas-hr`. See the following figure for reference

- Record their demos

**BROWNIE POINTS** if you can set up a GUI and make a functional webapp, even more if you have **observability**. Even more, if you can set up an MCP Server!
