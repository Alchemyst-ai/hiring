# Platform Assignment
## Steps
- Sign up on [Google Cloud (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com). You will get $300 free credits, enough for the test.
- Create an Express + React App with the following specifications:
  - Connects to the Alchemyst APIs. See the [LLM Proxy](https://getalchemystai.com/#get-started) and [Documentation](https://github.com/Alchemyst-ai/awesome-saas/?tab=readme-ov-file#learn-about-the-alchemyst-apis)
  - Create a deepresearch agent that uses jobs and message queues for deep-research and long running tasks. Hint: Use [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) and [AgendaJS](https://github.com/agenda/agenda) for event driven arch. Set them up in GCP.
  - Vibe-code a basic UI
  - Show how many concurrent requests you can maintain
  - Show how cost efficient your work is
  
**BROWNIE POINTS** if you can set up OpenTelemetry and pair up Observability with Grafana, and monitors on scheduled Agenda DB jobs.
