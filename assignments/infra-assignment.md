# Infra Assignment
## Steps
- Sign up on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com). You will get $300 free credits, enough for the test.
- Find which of the inference frameworks are best for making an OpenAI-compatble inference server for a 7B LLM. Some examples: SGLang, vLLM
- Host a simple OpenAI compatible inference server image with a small 7B model (like Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct) in Google K8s cluster (or equivalent)
- Clone and run [SyllabAI](https://github.com/Alchemyst-ai/SyllabAI), and change the base OpenAI URL in it with the URL generated by GKE.
- Run the repo.
- Check GKE on three parameters:
  - Usage
  - Tokens/s (by checking logs)
  - Pricing of containers used
**BROWNIE POINTS** if you can set up OpenTelemetry and pair up Observability with Grafana
